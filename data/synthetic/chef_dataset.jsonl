{"instruction": "Can I use honey instead of sugar in cookies?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you can use honey, but it is liquid, so you may need to reduce other liquids in the recipe. The cookies may be softer and browner due to the natural sugars."}
{"instruction": "Can I use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream in a dip?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Greek yogurt can replace sour cream. The texture will be similar, but the taste will be tangier and slightly less rich."}

{"instruction": "Can I use margarine instead of butter for saut\u00e9ing vegetables?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but margarine contains more water, which may cause slight steaming instead of browning. Flavor will be less rich than butter."}
{"instruction": "Can I use fresh herbs instead of dried in a recipe?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you generally need three times as much fresh herbs to replace dried ones. Fresh herbs provide brighter flavor but may alter cooking time."}
{"instruction": "Can I use rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, rice vinegar can be used. The acidity is similar, but it is milder and slightly sweeter, so the flavor will be less sharp."}

{"instruction": "Can I use plain flour instead of self-raising flour?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you need to add a leavening agent like baking powder. Otherwise, baked goods will be denser."}
{"instruction": "Can I use canola oil instead of sunflower oil for frying?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, both have high smoke points and neutral flavors, so the substitution is straightforward with minimal impact."}
{"instruction": "Can I use margarine instead of ghee in Indian cooking?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but margarine has more water content, so the flavor will be less rich and nutty than ghee. It may also produce some splattering."}

{"instruction": "I want to scale up cookies by 3x. How do I bake?", "input": "", "output": "Bake in batches. Each cookie\u2019s time depends on thickness and size, not total dough. Oven load may slightly affect baking, so monitor each batch."}
{"instruction": "If I double soup ingredients, do I need a bigger pot?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, a bigger pot ensures even heat distribution and prevents overflow. Cooking time may increase slightly due to volume, but not double."}
{"instruction": "I want to halve a casserole recipe. Do I halve cooking time?", "input": "", "output": "Not strictly. Casserole time depends on depth of ingredients and heat penetration. Shallower ingredients may cook slightly faster, but always check for doneness."}
{"instruction": "If I use a wider pan for brownies, do I reduce baking time?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Thinner batter in a wider pan usually cooks faster. Monitor closely and test for doneness."}
{"instruction": "I want to double cookies in one tray. Do I double time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Each cookie cooks individually based on size. More cookies may slightly affect oven airflow, but baking time is similar."}
{"instruction": "If I double rice, do I double water and cooking time?", "input": "", "output": "You double water, but cooking time does not double. Larger volume may take longer to reach boil, but simmering time is roughly the same."}
{"instruction": "I want to triple pancakes. Do I triple cooking time per pancake?", "input": "", "output": "No. Each pancake cooks individually. You may need more batches, but time per pancake remains the same."}
{"instruction": "If I make a bigger batch of soup, do I need higher heat?", "input": "", "output": "No. Heat should remain moderate to ensure even cooking. Larger volume may need slightly longer to reach simmer, but increasing heat excessively risks uneven cooking."}
{"instruction": "I want to double muffins in one oven. Do I double baking time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Baking time depends on batter volume per muffin, not total batch. Larger oven load may slightly affect heat distribution, so monitor closely."}
{"instruction": "If I double brownies in two pans, how do I adjust time?", "input": "", "output": "Each pan bakes independently. Time remains similar, though oven may require slight adjustment for airflow."}
{"instruction": "I want to halve a quiche recipe. Do I reduce baking time?", "input": "", "output": "Slightly. Shallower filling may bake faster, but always check with a toothpick; do not simply halve time."}
{"instruction": "If I double meat in a stew, do I double simmering time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Simmering time depends on size of meat chunks and heat penetration, not total mass. Slightly longer time may be needed, but not double."}
{"instruction": "I want to triple soup. Do I increase simmering time linearly?", "input": "", "output": "Not linearly. Heat penetration determines time. Larger volume may need extra minutes, but check for doneness rather than using a multiplier."}
{"instruction": "If I scale bread recipe by 2x, do I double kneading time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Kneading depends on dough elasticity and gluten development, not batch size. Large batches may require more attention, but not double time."}
{"instruction": "I want to double cake in a bigger pan. Should I lower oven temperature?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, slightly lowering temperature can prevent over-browning while allowing thicker batter to cook through. Monitor doneness carefully."}
{"instruction": "If I double the batter for cupcakes, do I double baking time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Baking time depends on batter volume per cupcake. Each cupcake bakes in the same time; more batter just means more cupcakes to bake in batches."}
{"instruction": "I want to halve a soup recipe. Do I cook for half the time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Cooking time depends on ingredient doneness and heat penetration. Smaller volume may cook slightly faster, but not strictly half the time."}
{"instruction": "If I double pancakes, do I need to double griddle time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Each pancake cooks individually. You may need multiple batches, but individual cooking time remains the same."}
{"instruction": "I want to scale brownies by 1.5x. Do I change baking time?", "input": "", "output": "Slightly. A thicker pan may need a few extra minutes, but do not multiply time. Test with a toothpick for doneness."}
{"instruction": "If I double cookie dough, do I need a bigger oven?", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily. You can bake in batches, but if all trays go in simultaneously, oven airflow may reduce heat efficiency. Adjust racks and check baking closely."}
{"instruction": "I want to double lasagna ingredients in the same pan. Do I double baking time?", "input": "", "output": "No. Depth affects time. Doubling ingredients in the same pan increases thickness and may need slightly longer baking, but doubling time is excessive."}
{"instruction": "If I scale up pancake batter, do I adjust heat?", "input": "", "output": "No. Heat setting remains the same. Larger batches just mean more pancakes to cook sequentially; individual pancakes cook in the usual time."}
{"instruction": "I want to triple a quiche recipe. How does that affect baking?", "input": "", "output": "Baking depends on filling depth and pan size. Deeper quiches may require slightly longer time at slightly lower temperature. Always check with a knife or toothpick."}
{"instruction": "If I double a stew recipe, do I need to increase heat?", "input": "", "output": "Not higher heat; simmering should remain gentle for even cooking. Larger volume may require slightly longer to reach desired temperature."}
{"instruction": "I want to halve a casserole recipe. Do I adjust oven temp?", "input": "", "output": "No. Oven temperature stays the same. Baking time may be slightly shorter due to reduced depth, but always check for doneness."}
